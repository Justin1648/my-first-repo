### Geography

I live in the city of Denver, in the state of Colorado, in the United States of America.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Ender's Game* by Orson Scott Card
- *Flight of the Old Dog* by Dale Brown
- *The DaVinci Code" by Dan Brown

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Pasta House in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.
2. Waterbar in San Francisco, California.
3. Confetti's in Bellvue, Washington.
